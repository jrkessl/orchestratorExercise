# Orchestrator Exercise
This repository is about learning, exercising and saving for reference the commands to work with container orchestrators and useful related tools. 

## trabalhador
Here you have a piece of software in a container that connects to a database and writes an "I'm alive" signal. 
Useful references: building docker images, running docker containers, docker-compose file syntax (to use with docker-compose cli), PostgreSQL database in a container.

## dockerSwarm
This is a play with dockersamples/examplevotingapp from hub.docker.com. With this app you vote and then check voting results.
Useful references: how to launch VMs to run orchestrators; initializing docker swarm; docker-compose file syntax (to use with docker swarm); launching a stack in docker swarm; playing with the stack; removing the stack.
